      "text": "When a sword is drawn from a scabbard enchanted with Swift Strike, the enchantment imparts a large amount of momentum to the sword. With proper technique, a skilled swordsman can use this boost to perform a wide slash, dealing very high damage to a small group of enemies. Performing this attack is very taxing on the enchantment's matrix, and as such incurs a long cooldown."
