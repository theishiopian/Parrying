      "text": "In the heat of battle, a peculiar phenomenon has been noted when using a ranged weapon; it becomes very easy to lose track of how much ammo you have left. This probability altering enchantment takes advantage of this, resulting in a random chance to not consume an arrow when firing. This works with ANY kind of arrow, not just normal arrows like with the Infinity enchantment."
