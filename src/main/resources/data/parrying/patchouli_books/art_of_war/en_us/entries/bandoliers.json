Fortunately, there is a simple solution: the humble bandolier $(br2) A bandolier is a strap of leather with small loops on it for holding useful yet unstackable items, including most potions, oils, and daggers.

Right clicking a bandolier cycles the items, and shift right clicking places the first item in the bandolier into your other hand, assuming said hand is empty. $(br2) Whenever you consume a bandolier-compatible item, the first bandolier in your inventory will try to give you the first item in its inventory."

I don't think writing \"diamond\" on the tag of a shirt makes it armor. Anyways, I digress. $(br2) Bandoliers can be crafted with rabbit, and can be dyed any color."

However, recent anthropological findings indicate that witch covens have been using bandoliers for centuries to compensate for their lack of an inventory."
