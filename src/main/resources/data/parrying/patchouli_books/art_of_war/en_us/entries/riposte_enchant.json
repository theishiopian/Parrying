      "text": "Pronounced \"Repost\", this enchantment is quite rare. It can be used on a sword or an axe, and is intended to empower a counterattack against those that would dare to challenge you. When the weapon parries a blow, this enchantment converts the force into energy for the wielder, granting a surge of strength. This burst of power can be somewhat intoxicating, so caution is advised."
