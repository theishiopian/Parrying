However, one of the biggest contributors to the success of the rabbit is its agility. $(br2) In combat, you must be like the rabbit, ready to dodge at a moment's notice."

This may take practice to get right, but once mastered, the dodge offers an unparalleled increase in agility. $(br2) Dodging in melee can be a useful way to circumvent the parry of an opponent, or to move out of reach to eat a snack. In ranged combat, a good dodge can save you from an unwanted arrow to the face."

It is up to you to decide your strategy. $(br2) Speaking of rabbits, potions made from their feet are an excellent way to increase one's jumping abilities. When dodging, one can benefit from this fact. A Potion of Leaping can increase the distance one can dodge by an appreciable distance."
