What makes it particularly useful, however, is that it makes said sword much easier to access. By simply pressing a key (by default \"r\") you can immediately swap out your current item with a sword. This is particularly useful if you need the hot-bar space,"

Weapon smiths have been known to occasionally sell them, though their prices tend to be quite high when dealing with players. Alternatively, if you don't want to pay for a scabbard, you can steal one from various loot chests. Sometimes it will even come with a sword already in it!"
