Composed of rabbit hide, it is somewhat expensive, but many would say it is a worthy investment. $(br2) A quiver can store up to 256 arrows, of any type or combination of types. Due to its ergonomic design, bows and crossbows will automatically draw from quivers"

However, the quiver also has a few tricks up its rabbit hide sleeve. For starters, the quiver can be used to quickly and easily determine what arrow to use. The first stack in the quiver will be the one used by bows and crossbows."

This will cycle the items round-robin style, allowing you to select a different stack. $(br2) When a quiver is thrown, holding onto the strap, by crouching, causes the arrows to get thrown out instead, making the quiver easy to empty. Thus, unlike bundles, accidentally dropping all your items is not a huge risk. A shameful design flaw, really..."

      "text": "In addition to being incredibly useful, quivers can also be very colorful. Just like leather armor, quivers can be dyed a multitude of colors. Simply craft any dyes with the quiver, using multiply dyes to make non-standard colors. To remove dyes, simply use the quiver on a water-filled cauldron. $(br2) This practice is common among fletchers, who will often sell dyed quivers for a \"Reasonable\" price."

Some of these ancient quivers can be found in various loot chests, or as drops from certain creatures that use bows or crossbows. These quivers will often contain a few arrows of varying types, depending on what types of arrows the owner used, before you appropriated their ammunition that is."
