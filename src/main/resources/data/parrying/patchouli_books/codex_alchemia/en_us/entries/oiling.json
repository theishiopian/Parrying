Arrows, splash potions, and stew-based trickery are all options, but sometimes you want your stab to sting just a bit more. $(br2) That's where oils come in. Oils are special potions that can be applied to melee weapons. Any melee weapon may have oil applied, and any potion can be turned into an oil by adding honeycomb in a brewing stand."

The oil will be smeared onto the weapon, and the weapon will take on the color of the applied potion. Oils can be removed by right clicking on a cauldron with the weapon in hand. If an oil is applied to a weapon that already has oil, the old oil will be removed and replaced with the new oil."
